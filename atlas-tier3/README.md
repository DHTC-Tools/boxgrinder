This is a Tier 3 image used by the University of Chicago. This appliance builds
a Condor-based worker node with access to CVMFS, PNFS, and the local Tier 3
data. There is a public key added in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys for root access
to the machine. There are probably other things that would need to be changed
in order to use this image elsewhere.
